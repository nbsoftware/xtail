This is a Debian prepackaged version of xtail.  It was put together by
Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org> with sources obtained from
<URL:http://www.unicom.com/sw/xtail/>.

The source has been modified so that it handles files which are renamed
properly.

The code is available under the terms of the BSD license.  On Debian
systems, this license can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/BSD'.

The original source distribution doesn't contain copyright terms.  Here's
the response Chip Rosenthal sent me when I contacted him about them:

You may use it under the terms of the BSD license.  Does that work
for you?
